Anyone who’s invited to collaborate in a file or folder can create their own link to share with others. If you’re an admin on a Dropbox team, you can control the access settings for folders. Learn how to manage shared link settings for your team. If you’re a member of a Dropbox team account, you can still choose who you want to share the link with, even if the team admin changes default link sharing settings. Dropbox is moving to an updated shared link architecture where links are based on content rather than on users. This will affect how links are created and shared. The new links can be identified by the presence of an ‘rlkey’ parameter in the URL. For these links, the above behavior will perform differently: Users with view-only access can only create view-only links, but users with edit access can create both edit or view-only links if links have not already been created. Only one edit link and one view-only link can exist per file or folder. How to share a link to a Dropbox file or folder You can generate a link to any file or folder in your Dropbox account and share it with others. When sharing via a link, you can grant recipients either edit or view-only access. You can also customize and manage their permissions in your default sharing settings for greater control.

When this happens, Dropbox will create a new folder within your team member folder named “[filename] (permission conflicts)”. How do I resolve a permission conflict? The best way to resolve a permission conflict is to request edit access to the original folder and add your file. You can then delete the permission conflict file. If you want edit access to a folder, you can request it directly from the file owner . You can reach out to your admin if you don’t know who the file owner is. If you’re the owner of the shared folder, you can follow the instructions above to change the folder permissions to allow more people to edit. Was this article helpful?

        "text": "Manage team sharing settings - Dropbox Help How to manage sharing settings for your team Updated Feb 20, 2025 person icon This article describes settings available to certain types of admins on Dropbox Standard, Advanced, Business, Business Plus, and Enterprise. If you’re an admin for a Dropbox team account, you can manage sharing settings for your entire team. To access sharing settings in the admin console: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . highlighter icon Note: Changes to these settings don't apply retroactively. Sharing outside your team These settings allow you to choose individual Dropbox products to allow or limit sharing outside the team. Sharing externally This setting controls whether team members can invite people outside the team to view or edit files and folders by email or entire email domains. warning icon Important : When this setting is On , anyone with access can share the contents. Make sure your team only shares files and folders with people you trust. You can also monitor team sharing activity in the admin console . On (Anyone): Team members can share with both people who are on the team and people who aren’t on the team. If this setting is Off, your team doesn’t have access to Dropbox Replay unless you have already purchased the Replay Add-On . If you have, you’ll still see Replay but it won’t adhere to your global Dropbox external sharing settings. On (Team + approved): Team members can only share with people who are on the team and people on the team’s approved list. Off (Team only): Team members can only share with people who are on the team. highlighter icon Notes: If you choose to allow sharing externally, you can view a list of the top email address domains that your team is sending files to in the admin dashboard . However, this list won’t include sharing via links. This setting doesn’t affect existing access. Team members can manage view and comment permissions directly in Dropbox Replay in each media file’s share settings. Team members can revoke permissions in Dropbox Replay by disabling existing shared links. Learn more about managing permissions in Dropbox Replay . If Sharing externally is set to On (team + approved) , you can add individual users by email or entire email domains. To add people or valid email domains to the approved list: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console . Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . Click Show approved list . Fill in the emails or domain names that you want to add to the exception list. ​​Click X next to an email or domain to remove it. highlighter icon Notes: Adding a top-level domain, for example “example.com”, will also allow members to share with subdomains such as “x.example.com” or “y.example.com”. The approved list does not apply to shared links. Share links outside your team This setting controls whether team members can share links with people outside the team. highlighter icon Note: Your link restriction policies only apply to team members. If you give an external partner access to a file or folder, they can create a link to share that content with others, even if your team’s Sharing links externally policy is set to Off. On : Team members can share links with people outside the team. Team members can override the Default shared link privacy setting described below. Off : Team members can’t share links with people outside the team or create new links. In addition, existing links created by team members will no longer work for people outside the team. highlighter icon Notes: Dropbox is moving to an updated shared link architecture where links are based on content rather than on users. This will affect how links are created and shared. The new links can be identified by the presence of an ‘rlkey’ parameter in the URL. For these links, the above behavior will perform differently. If you share a file or folder with an external partner using a link, they can share it with other external parties with the same link. They can’t create their own shared link since each file or folder can only have one edit link and one view-only link. Share Send and track links warning icon Important : Dropbox Send and track will be discontinued starting March 31, 2025. After this date, existing users' files will be stored in the “Send and track” folder on their Dropbox account (Files that predate February 15, 2024, need to be manually downloaded from the Send and track hub or they’ll be permanently deleted). Links will be disabled, but users can reshare the files through Dropbox (without analytics) or through a newly-created DocSend account. This setting applies to files sent using Send and track . To manage this setting: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . Under the Allow sharing outside your team , toggle Share “Send and track” links on to allow team members to share “Send and track” links outside the team. Send signature requests This setting applies to files sent using the Signatures page . To manage this setting: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . Under the Allow sharing outside your team section, toggle Send signature requests on to allow team members to send signature requests outside the team. Share files using Transfer This setting applies to files sent using Dropbox Transfer . To manage this setting: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . Under the Allow sharing outside your team section, toggle Share files using Transfer on. Share Replay links This setting applies to links sent using Dropbox Replay . To manage this setting: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Under Content , click Sharing . Under the Allow sharing outside your team section, click Manage next to Share Replay links to open up Replay and manage shared links directly. Shared file link settings These settings apply to files shared by links. They don’t apply to Signatures activity, Dropbox Replay, Dropbox Transfer, or “Send and track” links. Default access for shared links This setting controls the default privacy of shared links created by team members. Team members: Only team members can access shared links by default. Anyone with link: Anyone can access shared links by default, regardless of whether or not they’re part of the team. Only people invited: Team members must invite someone to access the link they create. Default permissions for shared links This setting controls the default permissions for shared links created by team members. Off : Team members can specify their own default permissions for shared links. Edit : Anyone with access to the file via link can edit it. View-only: Anyone with access to the file via link can only view it. highlighter icon Notes: Team members can override the default shared link privacy and permission settings and choose to give anyone access to shared links. If you want to set an expiration or require a password, you must set the default access for shared links to Team members or Only people invited . Set an expiration for new links shared outside your team This setting allows you to set a specific expiration date for shared links created by team members. After the selected date, Dropbox will automatically disable the shared link. Anyone attempting to access the link after the expiry date will be given an error message. highlighter icon Note: You can Set an expiration for links shared outside your team . From here, you have the option to Allow members to remove or change expiration for the shared link. Require password for new links shared outside your team This setting allows your team members to set an access password when creating a shared link. On : People with the link will need a password to view it. The team member who creates the link needs to share the password with the recipient. Off : The recipient doesn’t need a password to access shared links. Blanket link restrictions If you’re an admin on a Dropbox team, you can manage link access to your team’s shared folders and subfolders. Enabling link restrictions prevents Dropbox users who haven’t been added to a shared folder from accessing that folder via link. This overrides individual folder sharing settings. On : All shared folders will have link restrictions enabled. Off : Link restrictions will not be enabled by default, but team members can still enable them on specific shared folders. highlighter icon Note: Blanket link restrictions only apply to your team’s folders and subfolders. They do not apply to shared folders owned by someone else. If you’re not an admin, you can set link restrictions for individual folders that you own. To do this: Log in to dropbox.com. Hover over the name of the folder and click Share . In the popup, click ☑ (settings). Select the Folder settings tab. Toggle Link restrictions to ‘On’. Folders shared with the team Adding outside folders Choose if team members can add editable folders from outside of your Dropbox team: Log in to dropbox.com with your admin credentials. Click Admin console in the left sidebar. Click Settings . Click Sharing . Under Folders shared with the team , toggle Adding outside folders to On . highlighter icon Note: When turning this setting off, folders that members are invited to view only won’t be affected.

        "text": "Customize security for your Dropbox team - Dropbox Help How can I customize security for my Dropbox team? Updated Nov 12, 2024 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox customers. We understand that you need to keep your organization’s information safe , which is why we’ve designed Dropbox with a number of physical and technical security measures . If you’re an admin on a Dropbox team, you have access to features that allow you to customize security to your particular needs. User provisioning Users can be invited to a Dropbox team manually by sending an email invite from the admin console, or automatically by integrating with an existing Active Directory or LDAP deployment through one of our identity management providers. Sharing permissions Admins can control whether team members are able to share items with people outside the team, and set different rules for shared folders and shared links. If sharing outside the team is enabled, members will still be able to make individual folders or links “team only” as needed. Authentication Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to put your existing identity provider in charge of authentication. Two-step verification can also be enabled to add an extra layer of security. In addition, admins can reset passwords for individual users or the entire team. Session control Admins can remotely sign team members out of web sessions and devices and revoke third-party app access for any team members. Password control Admins can set password requirements or reset passwords for their teams. Enabling password control will log out all team members, notify them of new password requirements, and prompt them to reset their passwords. Admins can also choose to reset passwords for all of their team members. This will prompt each team member to choose a new password the next time they log in to Dropbox. The option to reset all passwords is available in the password control section of the admin console. Connecting personal and work Dropbox accounts Admins can turn off team members’ ability to use our desktop application for both personal and work Dropbox accounts at the same time. Transferring data during offboarding When removing users from a Dropbox team, admins have the ability to transfer their data to another user. Remote wipe If a device is lost or someone leaves the organization, admins can easily delete files and folders from computers and mobile devices once they come back online. Encryption options Advanced key management and end-to-end encryption are available to provide an extra layer of security. Visibility Admins can generate activity reports at any time for events related to passwords, logins, admin actions, apps, devices, sharing , and membership. Reports are available for individual users or entire team accounts and can be downloaded in CSV (comma-separated values) format for analysis with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.

Updated Jan 29, 2025 person icon The information in this article applies to customers on Dropbox Business and Business Plus. The Dropbox Business API is an extension of the Dropbox Platform to help you meet your team where they’re working.

Dropbox Business admins can install apps that grant them different access types to anything listed in a work account. Team members can view the apps connected to their work accounts (apps with team-member-file access permission) by visiting the Account security page .

        "text": "Package files and Dropbox - Dropbox Help Package files and Dropbox Updated Jan 24, 2025 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users. Package files and flattened package files are file formats used in Apple computers (macOS). They're used most often by applications like Keynote (.key), Pages (.pages), GarageBand (.band) and others. While package files and flattened package files appear to be single files when viewed on an Apple computer, they actually contain many other files and are represented as folders on non-Apple computers and most web browsers. How to upload package files to Dropbox There are several ways to upload package files to Dropbox while ensuring compatibility on all your computers, devices, and browsers. You can upload package files on dropbox.com by doing one of the following: Drag-and-drop the package file to dropbox.com (if your browser supports it) Zip the file, then upload it using the Upload button To upload package files to the Dropbox desktop app, move or copy the file into the Dropbox folder on your computer. The Dropbox desktop application will then sync the file in the correct format. How to zip a file for uploading If you are on a Mac computer, you may need to zip a package file to upload it to Dropbox. To do this: Open Finder . Right-click the file, then click Compress… Package files on macOS 12.5 and later The updated Dropbox for macOS experience introduced changes in how package files behave on macOS 12.5 and later. You can expect the following: Flattened package files can only be accessed on devices running Dropbox for macOS . They won’t be displayed on non-Mac devices or Mac devices not updated to macOS 12.5 or later. Flattened package files have the same functionality as previous package files. Once you’re on the updated Dropbox for macOS experience, existing package files will be updated to flattened package files the next time they are changed and synced. When viewed on dropbox.com, these flattened package files will appear as files and not as directories . Packages downloaded from dropbox.com can be extracted as .tar archives. Dropbox Transfer doesn’t currently support flattened package files. Was this article helpful? Yes, thanks Not really Let us know how why it didn't help: Thanks for letting us know!

Learn how to find out if you're eligible for this update . highlighter icon Note : While we recommend opting in to the latest version of Dropbox on File Provider, this migration isn’t required to continue using Dropbox. The following charts outline the changes you can expect when using Dropbox on File Provider. We will continue to update this list as we work to improve the Dropbox for macOS experience. Changes introduced by the File Provider API The changes below are set requirements of the File Provider API and are controlled by macOS. Updates Additional information Sync icons have changed to match updated macOS icons. The sync icons next to your files and folders in the Dropbox desktop app are now handled by the File Provider API. Sync performance is now regulated by macOS. Sync performance may slow to preserve battery life when your computer has low battery, isn't plugged in, or is running hot. Changing the location of your Dropbox folder isn't supported by Dropbox on File Provider. Your Dropbox folder in Finder is now under Locations instead of Favorites . Due to the change of the Dropbox folder location, files that were previously linked in some third-party applications will need to be linked again. Individual folders can be moved from your Dropbox folder to Favorites for quick access. You can change the Dropbox folder back to its original location by opting out of Dropbox on File Provider. Learn more about opting out . Your Dropbox folder will be moved to ~/Library/CloudStorage. Storing your Dropbox Folder on an External Drive We’ve begun rolling out support for moving the location of your Dropbox folder onto compatible external drives for some users. Learn more about external drive support for Dropbox on File Provider . Displaying Dropbox in the Finder toolbar isn’t supported by Dropbox on File Provider. Apple no longer allows you to add Dropbox when customizing the Finder toolbar . Packages now behave like regular files instead of directories. New macOS packages appear as regular files, but are actually bundles that contain other file types within. Examples of macOS packages include .pages, .numbers, and .key. This new format will have the same functionality as previous package files. Existing packages will be updated to the new format the next time they are changed and synced. New macOS packages can only be accessed on devices running Dropbox on File Provider. Some types of files aren't supported on Dropbox on File Provider. Apple no longer allows Photos Library to be synced over cloud-storage services . Final Cut Pro libraries can’t be saved or opened in the Dropbox folder. Apple no longer allows Adobe InDesign Lock files (.idlk) to be synced over cloud storage services. Dropbox files or folders not previously set to Make available offline may be automatically set to online-only when your hard drive is low on disk space. To prevent this from occurring, you need to set your files to Make available offline . This setting will prevent the File Provider from setting files to online only. Learn more about how to make a file or folder available offline in Dropbox. Only files that are marked available offline will display as occupying disk space. Opening an online-only file from the Dropbox desktop app downloads a file to your computer, but macOS won’t include these files when calculating occupied disk space. Files not explicitly marked as available offline will be made online-only automatically if your hard drive is low on disk space. Marking files as available offline will prevent this switch. Occupied disk space will then be displayed accurately. Known limitations We are actively working to address customer feedback. This list will be revised regularly as updates are made to both the File Provider API and Dropbox on File Provider. Updates Additional information Dropbox Transfer doesn’t support new macOS packages. The new packages are currently not supported by Dropbox Transfer . Actions involving a large number of files can take longer than usual to complete. Syncing or updating a Dropbox account with over 300,000 files can take longer than in previous versions. Utilizing selective sync can help speed up migration by reducing the number of files you have stored on your hard drive. Certain types of files may not sync on macOS 12. Files or folders may not sync if their name contains the byte-order mark (BOM). Files or folders may not sync if their name begins with a space followed by a single digit. The issues above are resolved on macOS 13 and later. Using multiple versions of the Dropbox desktop app on your device may cause syncing issues. We recommend uninstalling all versions of the Dropbox desktop app, then reinstalling the latest version. LAN sync is currently not supported. Users on the same LAN won’t have increased syncing speed. Certain files or folders with very long names or that are located in deeply-nested folder structures won't be synced. The name length limit for a file or folder will depend on the entire path. The current path length limit is 8,096 characters. Some types of files may not be synced while an application is actively editing them. On macOS 13 and later, these files will be clearly identified in the View sync issues window on the Dropbox desktop app. To resume syncing, close the applications that are actively editing these files. AirDrop won't work if Dropbox Backup is enabled. This is a known issue. Contact Dropbox support for help resolving this issue on your device. Running CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Security Extension and Dropbox simultaneously may cause system errors. If you're running CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Security Extension on macOS 13.2 or earlier, we won't migrate you onto the updated Dropbox for macOS at this time. This issue is resolved on macOS 13.3 or later. Safari can’t open .html or .css files without Full Disk Access permission. Opening an .html or .css file from Dropbox can result in an error in Safari. To continue using Safari: Click the Apple logo in the top left of your screen. Open System Settings . Click Privacy & Security . Click Full Disk Access . Click “ + ” (plus sign) Select Safari . Click Open . Linked Dropbox accounts can’t be on different experiences on the same device. If you have two Dropbox accounts linked on a device, both accounts must meet the eligibility requirements to migrate to Dropbox on File Provider on that device. If both accounts are eligible, after choosing to migrate to the Dropbox on File Provider, both accounts will be updated on startup of the Dropbox desktop app. If one account is ineligible, both accounts will remain on the legacy Dropbox for macOS experience. If you have two linked accounts but only one is logged into the Dropbox app on your device, you can migrate that account if it is eligible. Was this article helpful?

        "text": "Sync icons on Dropbox for macOS on File Provider - Dropbox Help Sync icons on Dropbox for macOS on File Provider Updated Sep 29, 2023 person icon This article is for customers on Dropbox for macOS on File Provider. If you haven’t updated to this version of Dropbox, your icons might look slightly different. There are two locations where sync icons appear: In the Dropbox folder on your computer In the menu bar Sync icons in the Dropbox folder To see the sync status of a specific file or folder: Open the Dropbox folder in Finder. Locate the file or folder you'd like to check. Note: You can use the search bar in the top right to find the file or folder. Look at the sync icon next to the file or folder. magic wand icon Tip: Hovering over an icon will give you a description of its current state. Available offline A solid green circle with a white checkmark means your file or folder is synced and available offline . You will see this icon after right-clicking a file or folder and selecting Make available offline. “Available offline” means that your file or folder is available when you’re not connected to internet. For folders, this icon means all files in the folder are available offline. Note: Files and folders that are available offline won’t automatically change to online-only regardless of available hard drive space. Online-only A cloud icon with a down arrow means your file or folder is synced and online-only until it is opened. “Online-only” means that you’ll need to be connected to the internet to initially open this file or folder. Once opened, this file or folder will become available in the desktop app to be opened at any time. For folders, this icon means there is at least one online-only file in the folder. There can also be files that are “available” and/or “available offline” in the folder. Folders with both an “Online-only” and “Available offline” icon will contain at least one online-only file, but any newly added files will become available offline by default. Syncing A cloud means that your file or folder is in the queue to be synced, but has not yet started uploading to the server. “Synced” means that any changes you made to this file or folder are reflected everywhere you access your files in Dropbox. The icon will shift to the circular progress indicator when it begins syncing. Sync in progress A circular progress indicator means that your file or folder is in the process of syncing. This icon will appear when files or folders are changed or are switched between online-only and available offline. It will also appear when a download is initiated. The length of time this icon appears will depend on the amount of data that is being synced. Sync error A cloud with an exclamation point inside means that your file or folder can’t update or sync. If you just attempted to add this file or folder to your Dropbox account, it may mean that it can’t be added. Learn about the different types of sync errors and how to solve them . Ignored file A cloud with a diagonal line through it means that your file is ignored and doesn’t count towards the storage space in your Dropbox account. That means it’s stored in the Dropbox folder on your Mac, but not on dropbox.com or on the Dropbox server. Learn more about ignored files . Available A file or folder with no icon means that it has been opened either by double-clicking or through a third-party application and synced. For folders, no icon means there is at least one available file in the folder, but no online-only files. There can also be files that are available offline in the folder. Note: If your computer is low on hard drive space, these files can automatically change to online-only to free up space . What to do if your sync icons are missing If your sync icons are missing, close all non-Dropbox applications then quit and relaunch the Dropbox desktop app . The sync icons in the menu bar Below are the different Dropbox icons that will appear in your menu bar . The icon color may vary. Fully synced A solid black Dropbox icon with no other icon means the Dropbox files and folders on your computer are fully up to date. Any changes you made are reflected everywhere you use Dropbox. Sync in progress A solid black circle with two white arrows going in a circle means that the Dropbox files and folders on your computer are being updated.

Online-only files take up a small amount of space on your hard drive as the placeholder requires space to store the file name and the shortcut to dropbox.com. Still, this takes up much less space than the file itself would. If you’re using online-only files with macOS 10.13 to 12.2, you may notice that online-only files appear to take up space when you try to manage storage space in your Mac settings . The reason for this is that file size is calculated based on something called “logical size” rather than “physical size”. To see which files are really taking up your storage space, adjust your Dropbox settings so that online-only files have both logical and physical sizes set to zero. To do so: Log in to dropbox.com. Click your avatar (profile picture or initials) in the top-right corner. Click Settings . Toggle on Update for online-only files on Mac . Note: This setting may take some time to update.

Updated Dec 18, 2024 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users. The number of files you can store in your Dropbox account is limited by the amount of storage space in your Dropbox account . If you run out of space in your personal account, consider upgrading to Dropbox Plus or Professional . While you can store as many files in Dropbox as you have storage space for , you may not be able to store all of those files on your computer.

This article explains how to upgrade to the latest version of the Dropbox desktop app. To upgrade to the latest version of the Dropbox mobile app: Download the Dropbox iOS app Download the Dropbox Android app How to update to the most recent stable version of Dropbox on your computer If you want to manually update to the latest stable version of Dropbox, you can get it from our download page or our install page (for Linux users). Otherwise, the Dropbox desktop app will update automatically. How to see which version of Dropbox you're running To see which version of Dropbox you’re currently running on your computer: Click the Dropbox icon in your taskbar (Windows) or menu bar (Mac). Click your avatar (profile picture or initials) in the top right. Click Preferences . On Windows devices, it can be found at the bottom of the dialog box (underneath Language ). On macOS devices, the version can be found next to About Dropbox . Can I disable auto-updates? Like many programs and applications, Dropbox may automatically update to the latest version. These updates are rolled out gradually after a new update is available, and are necessary to keep Dropbox on your computer functioning. You cannot disable or turn off auto-updates. These updates ensure you’re running the most up-to-date version of Dropbox, which often has performance and security enhancements. And if Dropbox can't keep itself up-to-date, some features may stop working. For example, the app may stop syncing . highlighter icon Notes about auto-updates : If Dropbox software is installed on your computer, it will update regardless of whether you installed it or the application came preloaded by the device manufacturer. The proxy settings you add using these steps aren't used to update the Dropbox app. Dropbox uses your operating system network settings to apply auto-updates. Can I install a previous version of the Dropbox desktop app? If you're trying to install a previous version of the Dropbox desktop app, you'll likely encounter one of these error messages: You already have a more recent version of Dropbox installed on your machine. This installer is no longer supported. Please download a new version from /downloading. If you're encountering an error message, or if you're having trouble installing the Dropbox desktop app, visit our downloads page . highlighter icon Note : We don't recommend using previous versions, since the latest version includes the most up-to-date fixes and security updates. You should only downgrade to a previous version of Dropbox if instructed to do so by a member of the Dropbox support team. Was this article helpful?

        "text": "How to fix Dropbox not syncing and other issues - Dropbox Help Dropbox stopped syncing: how to fix Dropbox not syncing and other issues Updated Nov 15, 2024 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users, unless otherwise stated. Have your Dropbox files and folders stopped syncing, or are they stuck uploading? This article covers fixes for Dropbox sync issues and troubleshooting steps. Try the steps below if: Updates to your files aren’t syncing with people you share with Updates to your files aren’t reflecting in your own account on dropbox.com New files added by other people or devices aren’t syncing to your device The number of files syncing seems to be “stuck” You see errors about particular files Learn more about how Dropbox syncs your files . highlighter icon Note: If your device has an unreliable internet connection or a file is very large, it may take longer for Dropbox to sync. You can wait a few minutes for Dropbox to catch up. If that doesn’t work, try the steps below. Dropbox is stuck syncing forever, waiting to sync, not starting, or files are not uploading If your Dropbox desktop app is stuck syncing, waiting to sync, or not starting to sync, it may be due to your network settings or firewall: Check your firewall, security, and antivirus settings Check your network restrictions Check the date and time on your device Errors about low disk space on your computer or hard drive Dropbox has a few different tools for helping to manage your disk space on your device. If you want to remove files from your hard drive without deleting them from your Dropbox account, you can make those files online-only or use selective sync to choose which Dropbox folders sync to your hard drive. Learn how to make files online-only Learn how to use selective sync If you want to remove files from the Dropbox desktop app and the rest of your Dropbox account, you can either: Delete the file from your Dropbox folder or dropbox.com. Move the file out of your Dropbox folder and into a local folder on your hard drive. Can ’t move, open, or delete a file or folder from the Dropbox folder If you can’t make changes to a file or folder in your Dropbox folder, the first thing to confirm is whether the file is visible and can be edited on dropbox.com. Some applications will put restrictions in place that can prevent other applications (like Dropbox) from accessing your files while that other application has them open. This is to prevent conflicts between the two. If, after you’ve saved your file or quit the application you’re using, you’re seeing errors about that particular file, or it never seems to finish syncing, you may want to restart your computer in case a crashed or background application is accessing your files in a way that prevents Dropbox from syncing your changes. If you can’t see and edit your file on dropbox.com, the file may not be properly synced. Try these other troubleshooting steps below to resolve issues with the Dropbox desktop app syncing, starting with checking connectivity: Check your firewall, security, and antivirus settings Check your network restrictions Files are marked as “up to date” but are not If either dropbox.com or the desktop app is showing your files as being up to date but changes you’ve made aren’t appearing, it typically means one of two things: Your desktop app hasn’t yet uploaded the changes to your account on dropbox.com. Your desktop app hasn’t yet downloaded changes made in your account on dropbox.com. Usually, this will update automatically and you’ll simply need to wait for the files to finish syncing. If the desktop app doesn’t appear to be syncing, try the following troubleshooting steps: Check your firewall, security, and antivirus settings Check your network restrictions Learn how to change online-only file settings . File couldn’t sync due to a hardware issue or file corruption If Dropbox encounters errors while trying to read or write a file, there may be an issue with your desktop OS or hardware. You can use disk diagnostic and repair utilities to identify and repair errors: Windows: Use Check Disk ( chkdsk ). macOS: Use Disk Utility . How to check for disk errors warning icon Important : You must have administrator privileges to run chkdsk . Interrupting chkdsk isn’t recommended. The time it takes to run chkdsk depends on the size and speed of your drive, amount of data stored, and presence of potential errors.

Scan for problems by typing “chkdsk” and pressing Enter . Repair problems by typing “chkdsk /r” and pressing Enter . warning icon Important : You must have administrator privileges to run Disk Utility . Interrupting Disk Utility isn’t recommended.

If you’ve received an email asking you to configure your preferences for migration, then this article is for you. Learn how to create and share Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides in Dropbox. Dropbox is changing the way that Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are created and stored in Dropbox. If you’ve created any Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides on dropbox.com, you’ll need to configure your preferences to move or convert in order to maintain access to them. This change will ensure you can use up-to-date Google features while keeping your files organized with the rest of your Dropbox content. There are two options to do so: Move the files to Google Drive (GDrive) and replace them with Dropbox shortcuts. You’ll need to sign in and link to your Google Account in order to move files to Google Drive. This is the recommended option. Your Google files will be automatically migrated to Google Drive and replaced with corresponding shortcuts in Dropbox within 30 days. Convert the Google files (.gdoc, .gsheet, .gslide) to the equivalent Microsoft Office file formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). highlighter icon Note : If you don’t choose an option, your files will be automatically converted into Microsoft Office formats since we are unable to link your Google and Dropbox accounts. How to find Google files in your Dropbox account Use Dropbox search to review your Google files before uploading or converting your documents. To do this: Log in to dropbox.com. Click the search bar at the top of the page. Search for each individual file type: . gdoc , . gsheet , and . gslides . How to move your files to Google Drive To move your files, you can click the button in your email or the banner that pops up on dropbox.com. To do so: Log in to dropbox.com. A pop-up window will appear to move or convert your Google Files. Select Move Google files to Google Drive with shortcuts . Click Next . Click Link Account. Follow the prompts to link your Google account with the same email address as your Dropbox account. Once your accounts are linked, your Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides will be uploaded to a new folder called “Dropbox” on Google Drive and shortcuts to these files will be added to your Dropbox account to replace the original files. How to convert your files to Microsoft Office formats To convert your files, you can click the button in your email or the banner that pops up on dropbox.com. To do so: Log in to dropbox.com. A pop-up window will appear to move or convert your Google Files. Select Convert Google files to Microsoft Office files . Click Next . Your documents will automatically be converted to the equivalent file types in your Dropbox account. If you don’t see the option to move or convert files, you can do so from your account settings. To do this: Log in to dropbox.com. Click your avatar (profile picture or initials) in the top-right corner. Click Settings . Click Apps . Click Configure next to Manage preference and follow the prompts. Admins: How to manage the Dropbox integration with Google Drive If you’re a team or content admin , you can manage which file editing apps can be used by your team. If your team has created any Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides on dropbox.com , they’ll need to choose whether to move their files to Google Drive or convert them to the Microsoft Office equivalents. Moving their Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides to Google Drive ensures your team can use up-to-date Google features while keeping the files organized with the rest of the team’s Dropbox content. Google files can be opened and edited in Google Drive. highlighter icon Note: Google editor will no longer work for opening or editing non-Google files in Dropbox. To continue editing these files, an additional Microsoft Office license may be required. Google files that are in a team folder will be converted to Microsoft Office equivalents since they don’t have a single owner. However, you can move those converted files to Google Drive. To do so: Log in to dropbox.com. Click the name of a converted file to open the preview. Click File in the upper left. Click Save As… . Click Google Doc shortcut . Click Save to use the same sharing permissions as the original file. If you don’t want to keep being asked about permissions, check the box next to Don’t ask me again. If prompted, allow Dropbox access to your Google account. highlighter icon Note: If the Google Drive integration is disabled, your team’s files will automatically be converted to the Microsoft Office equivalents. Learn how to manage apps for your Dropbox team account. Once migration is completed, reports for users and admins will be generated as a .csv file. Admins will see a file titled “Google Migration Report - Admin.csv” in dropbox.com. FAQ What happens to my sharing settings if I move my files to Google Drive? If you move files to Google Drive, the same sharing settings will be applied to your Google files. highlighter icon Note: Some advanced Dropbox sharing settings don’t have direct Google equivalents, such as password protection and shared links accessible to members of your Dropbox team. In this case, we’ll apply only sharing settings supported by Google Drive and keep advanced sharing settings for Dropbox shortcuts created during migration. A migration report named “Google Migration Report.csv” will be added to your Dropbox account with these details. What happens to my sharing settings if I convert to Microsoft Office files? If you convert to Microsoft Office files, existing sharing settings will be respected. How do I know which option is the best? In most cases, we recommend moving your files over to Google Drive and using Dropbox shortcuts. If you use many shared folders or share with non-Google users, we recommend converting to Microsoft Office formats. What happens if I don’t do anything? If you don’t respond to the prompt by the date communicated to you via email, we’ll automatically convert your files into Microsoft Office formats since we are unable to automatically link your Google and Dropbox accounts. What do I do if I get an error message moving files to Google Drive? If any files were unable to be converted, you'll find a report in your Dropbox account titled “Google Migration Report.csv”. We also recommend checking your storage space on Google Drive and then manually uploading documents. Will my documents keep the same formatting after moving to Google Drive? Yes, your documents will keep the same formatting and content after moving to Google Drive. Will permission settings change after moving to Google Drive? You’ll be able to choose whether to apply the same permissions/roles when uploading to Google. If you have any group permissions, they’ll stay the same after your files are moved. Will I still be able to track version history in my documents? Dropbox shortcuts won’t track version history for changes made on Google Drive.  You’ll need to use Google Drive for that. What happens to storage in my Dropbox account? Moving files manually or as a result of the migration will free up space in your Dropbox account, but will impact storage capacity in your Google Drive account. What happens if a file I’m moving has the same name as an existing file in Google Drive? If a file you’re moving has the same name as an existing file in Google Drive, the duplicate file from dropbox.com will have a number appended to the name. For example: “example.docx” and  “example (1).docx”. Can I still open Microsoft files with Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides? You’ll no longer be able to open Microsoft Office files in Google Drive in Dropbox. To continue editing, an additional Microsoft Office license may be needed. Was this article helpful?

The only way a video, image, audio, or PDF file (and its comments) can be deleted from Replay is by directly removing it from your Replay dashboard. highlighter icon Note : If you’re the file owner and you delete your Replay file or project from your Replay dashboard, it can’t be undeleted.

If you were a beta user and you turn off password protection for a file, you won’t be able to turn it back on unless you buy the Replay Add-On. You’ll still be able to edit any existing passwords you'd already set on your files when you used the beta version of Replay or when you had the Replay Add-On. I used to have unlimited files and now I have a limit. How do I find the right files to delete to get under my quota?

Do I need to buy the Replay Add-On for my whole team? No. Admins on teams who pay by credit card can buy the add-on for specific team members. However, teams that don’t pay by credit card will need to buy a minimum of 10 add-ons for their team. Can I transfer a Replay Add-On from one team member to another team member?

        "text": "FAQs about ending support for Dropbox Capture - Dropbox Help FAQs about ending support for Dropbox Capture Updated Mar 07, 2025 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users, unless otherwise stated. On March 24, 2025, Dropbox Capture will be discontinued. This change will allow us to focus on building the best collaboration tools for your work within our core Dropbox product. What’s changing? You’ll no longer be able to access your Capture desktop app, or Capture from your web browser. This means that you won’t be able to create new screenshots, GIFs, or screen, audio, or video recordings in Capture. You also won’t be able to download the Capture desktop app or refer other people to Capture. You’ll also lose access to the Capture Collections surface. Any content within your Collections that you own will still be accessible through Dropbox within your “Capture” folder. This won’t impact your storage limits, as previously created Capture content has already been counted towards your storage.  If you have permission to access a Collection but don’t own the files, you won’t be able to see those files once Capture is discontinued. There’ll also be some minor changes taking place before Capture is fully discontinued. These changes will take place from February 27, 2025: The ability to add new comments and links to captures from Capture will be removed. You’ll still be able to comment through Dropbox previews. Comments on existing captures will be visible when you access your content through Dropbox previews. This migration will also take place for comments on captures stored in collections. If comments don’t appear immediately, they will be visible by the time Capture is discontinued. You won’t be able to edit team or individual Capture collections or create new ones. The Copy embed code option will no longer be available from the Share dropdown for recordings. You won’t be able to make a capture anonymous. If current Capture content is set to anonymous, you’ll have to change your sharing settings to prevent an error when someone attempts to access the content. Links to anonymous captures will no longer work once Capture is discontinued. For seven days following these changes taking place, you’ll be able to change the anonymity setting for all of your capture content from the Preferences page. Turning the toggle to off will remove anonymity from all of your content, and ensure existing Capture links will continue to function. Turning the toggle to on will maintain anonymity, but will stop existing Capture links from working. Dropbox links to the content will continue to function regardless of this setting. Capture links shared in Slack or included in a paper document will no longer unfurl. What’ll happen to existing capture content? Your captures are already saved by default in a Dropbox folder named “Capture,” and you won’t lose access to these files. If you’ve changed the default save location for your Captures to another folder, you can still access your captures in that folder. If you’ve been using Team Collections to share capture content with your team, the shared content will now be saved in the “Capture” folder of its creator. In order to maintain access for your team, you’ll need to move this content to a shared folder. Links to captures you’ve previously shared will redirect to a Dropbox file link and open as a Dropbox file preview. Any comments on your captures will also be viewable within Dropbox file preview. highlighter icon Note: Capture comments made through the quick reactions feature won’t transfer to the Dropbox file preview, and will be lost when Capture is discontinued. Your Dropbox storage limits won’t be impacted as captures previously created already count towards your storage. What tools can I use instead? You can still automatically save screenshots to your Dropbox account. To use this feature: Make sure the Dropbox desktop application is installed . Open your Dropbox desktop app preferences . Click Backups in the left sidebar. Check the box next to Share screenshots and screen recordings using Dropbox . On Windows computers, use the PrtScn key on your keyboard to take a screenshot. On a Mac use the cmd+shift+4 or cmd+shift+3 keyboard shortcuts. Learn more about saving screenshots to your Dropbox account. highlighter icon Note: The screenshot sync feature on won’t work on Windows if you use the Snipping tool, rather than the keyboard shortcut, to take a screenshot To create audio, camera, and screen recordings use your device’s native features. With the end of support for Capture, support for Capture collections will also be ending. If you’d like to organize your capture content, you’ll need to add your captures to folders, or tag your Capture content before Capture is discontinued. Learn more about adding content to folders. Learn more about tagging your content. Previews of Capture content will now happen in Dropbox, rather than through Capture. You’ll be able to add comments and remove filler words through this preview, but for advanced collaboration, it’s recommended you use Dropbox Replay. Viewer notifications and analytics will no longer be available through the Capture app. You can use DocSend for advanced analytics and viewer information. Learn more about the features of Dropbox DocSend. Will I be reminded of the change? If you’re an active user of Capture, you’ll receive an email notifying you of these changes on February 20, 2025.

Additionally, you’ll be able to view and restore previous versions of files and folders from 180 days ago, only 150 days after you have upgraded to the Professional plan (30 days of version history from the Basic plan, and 150 days to reach the extended version history of the new plan).

Disposition policies are based on when a file was created or uploaded. With a disposition policy, content will be automatically deleted at the end of the policy and permanently deleted 31 days after the end of the policy. While team members can delete content at any time, admins can still download the content any time before it’s permanently deleted. highlighter icon Notes : You can have up to 100 active data retention policies.

        "text": "How to clear the Dropbox cache folder - Dropbox Help How to clear the Dropbox cache folder Updated Nov 15, 2024 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users. The Dropbox cache is a hidden folder named \".dropbox.cache\" that is stored in your root Dropbox folder. You won't see this folder unless the ability to view hidden files and folders is enabled in your operating system. If you deleted a large number of files from your Dropbox, but your computer’s hard drive doesn't reflect these deletions, the files you deleted may be held in the cache folder. Dropbox keeps a cache of files for efficiency and emergency purposes. It's also used as a staging area for downloading and uploading files. Not using Dropbox yet? See how Dropbox can help you save space. How do I clear the Dropbox cache folder? Your cache folder is automatically cleared every three days. If you need to delete sensitive files immediately, or you need to clear up some space on your hard drive, you can manually clear the cache with the steps below. Open a new Windows Explorer or File Explorer window by clicking on the Start menu and then My Computer or My PC . Type or copy and paste the following code into the location bar at the top of the window and press return: %HOMEPATH%\\Dropbox\\.dropbox.cache This will take you directly to the Dropbox cache folder in your Application Data folder. Delete the files in your cache by dragging them out of the Dropbox cache folder and into your Windows Recycle bin. Dropbox team users : If you have a Dropbox team account linked to the desktop, the name of your Dropbox folder will be appended with your team name. For example, if you were clearing your cache on a Dropbox team account called \"Organization\" you'd see: %HOMEPATH%\\Organization Dropbox\\.dropbox.cache highlighter icon Note : You’ll need to replace “Organization” with your Dropbox team name in the path above. If you have a personal account linked to the desktop, the name of your Dropbox folder will be appended with your personal username in parentheses “(Personal)”. For example, if you were clearing your cache on a personal linked account, you’d see: %HOMEPATH%\\Dropbox (Personal)\\.dropbox.cache Open your Dropbox folder in Finder . Press Shift-Command-. (period). A folder named “.dropbox.cache” will appear. Open the “.dropbox.cache” folder. Delete the files in your cache by dragging them into your Trash .

        "text": "What Happens When I Delete files in Dropbox? - Dropbox Help What happens when I delete a file from my Dropbox account? Updated Jan 31, 2025 person icon The information in this article applies to all Dropbox users. When you delete a file from Dropbox, it's no longer visible in any of the folders you see in your account. However, the file isn’t deleted until after your recovery window. How long does Dropbox keep deleted files? Your default file recovery period depends on your Dropbox plan: Dropbox Basic, Plus, and Family customers have 30 days. Dropbox Professional, Standard, Essentials, and Business users have 180 days. Dropbox Advanced, Enterprise, Education, and Dropbox Business Plus users have 365 days. Learn more about the Dropbox data retention policy. highlighter icon Notes : Standard file recovery periods and options don’t apply to files deleted directly using the Send and track feature. Deleting a file using Send and track is permanent, and any associated metadata or data analytics can’t be recovered once the file is deleted. Any files added to Send and track before February 15, 2024 won’t be added to the “Send and track” folder on your Dropbox account. Deleting these files is permanent, and any associated metadata or data analytics can’t be recovered once the files are deleted. After this recovery window, all files will be deleted within 90 days in the normal course of operations. It may take several additional days to complete the deletion depending on the number of files selected for deletion. highlighter icon Note : Files may be deleted before the end of your recovery window if they are part of a data disposition policy . What happens when I permanently delete a file or folder? When you permanently delete a file or folder, it’s no longer visible in any of your folders and you can't recover it. What happens when I delete a shared folder? When you delete a file from a shared folder , any member of the folder can restore the file. If you own the shared folder After you permanently delete it, the folder is deleted from the Dropbox accounts of all members and their access is permanently removed. If you want to leave members with a copy of the folder, you can unshare it instead. If you don’t own the shared folder Permanently deleting it removes the folder from your Dropbox account. All other members of the folder still have access. What does Dropbox do with deleted files? Dropbox uses a secure deletion process to delete data from our servers. Additionally, when a Dropbox storage disk reaches the end of its useful life or is damaged, we follow a decommissioning process designed to physically or logically destroy the disk to the point data can't be recovered. Our third-party service providers also follow secure protection processes for media they control. Not using Dropbox yet? See how Dropbox makes file recovery and history easy. What happens when I delete a Send and track file? warning icon Important : Dropbox Send and track will be discontinued starting March 31, 2025. After this date, existing users' files will be stored in the “Send and track” folder on their Dropbox account (Files that predate February 15, 2024, need to be manually downloaded from the Send and track hub or they’ll be permanently deleted). Links will be disabled, but users can reshare the files through Dropbox (without analytics) or through a newly-created DocSend account. highlighter icon Note : Deleting file copies in Send and track is permanent. Any metadata and data analytics associated with that file can’t be recovered, even if the source file is left intact. Deleting files directly in Send and track won’t affect the source files in your Dropbox account, local drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, or the “Send and track” folder. Adding a file to the Send and track feature from your local drive, OneDrive, or Google Drive creates a file copy in the “Send and track” folder. This copy takes up storage space and counts towards your storage limit. Deleting this copy from the “Send and track” folder automatically removes the file stored in Send and track, along with any associated metadata and analytics. Restoring the file copy restores the Send and track file and its data. highlighter icon Note : Files added to Send and track before February 15, 2024, won’t be added to this folder and deleting those files will be permanent. Any metadata or analytics associated with that file can’t be recovered once deleted. Adding a file to Send and track directly from your Dropbox account doesn’t create an additional file copy in the “Send and track” folder. Deleting the original file from your Dropbox account automatically removes it, and any associated metadata and analytics, from Send and track as well. Restoring the original file restores the Send and track file and its data. highlighter icon Note : Deleting any files added to Send and track before February 15, 2024 is permanent. Any associated metadata or data analytics can’t be recovered once the file is deleted even if the source file is restored to your Dropbox account. Was this article helpful?

Dropbox is moving to an updated shared link architecture where links are based on content rather than on users. This will affect how links are created and shared. The new links can be identified by the presence of an ‘rlkey’ parameter in the URL. For these links, the above behavior will perform differently: Only users with edit access can delete shared links or modify link settings. Instead of deleting a link, you can restrict access for certain users by following the instructions to remove a member from a file or folder below. Users can add files or folders to their Dropbox accounts via shared links. If you want to remove someone’s access to a specific file or folder, you’ll need to both delete the shared link and remove the user from the access list.

When you create shared folders , you automatically become the owner. If you create a folder within someone else's shared folder, they become the owner. However, you can transfer ownership to someone else by changing the parent folder's sharing permissions. Transferring ownership of the folder won't transfer the ownership of the shared links . Shared links with view-only permissions are tied to the person who originally created the link. One of the remaining members will need to create a new link to share individual files in the folder. Learn more about a shared folder owner’s permissions. Not using Dropbox yet? See how Dropbox helps you effortlessly share files and folders. highlighter icon Notes : View-only shared links for web-based files (online-only files like Paper docs or Google Sheets) will remain active. Dropbox is moving to an updated shared link architecture where links are based on content rather than on users. This will affect how links are created and shared. The new links can be identified by the presence of an ‘rlkey’ parameter in the URL. For these links, the above behavior will perform differently: When you transfer ownership of a shared folder, shared links will remain active and link ownership will transfer to the new owner. Users with view-only access can only create view-only links. Users with edit access can create both edit or view-only links if links have not been created already. View-only and edit links are different. You‘re unable to change a view-only link into an edit link or vice versa.
