We currently support integrations with Intuit Quickbooks, Zoho Books, Zoho Expense, Expensify, Netsuite and many more. Zluri will build more integrations in future and add to this list. From the Zluri Home page, if we go to Sources - - > Integrations - - > Browse Catalog, we can get all the financial integrations currently supported if we search “finance” under Categories. Please refer to the below snapshots: This is how the Transactions section currently looks: There are five sections within Transactions: Recognised Transactions: These are the transactions which Zluri has recognised from the financial integrations and has mapped to an application and are SaaS related. For mapping the transaction, we use the Transaction Description. If the Transaction Description matches the application name, Zluri maps the transaction to that application. Unrecognised Transactions: These are the transactions unrelated to SaaS, or Zluri has not been able to recognise from the financial integrations and has not mapped to any application. Archived Transactions: These are the transactions which are non-SaaS related. Also, any other transaction that customers don’t want to be included can be archived. Customers can move these types of transactions to Archive so that their data is not visible on the dashboard. Payment Methods: Customers can add payment methods like Credit cards, Bank Accounts and other Payment Options on this page. Zluri sends notifications to customers if any payment method is nearing its expiry date. Uploads: The customer can upload the transaction data as a CSV file which needs to have data in a specific format to upload the data. Updated 19 days ago"

        "text": "Access Reviews in Zluri Access Reviews is a critical process performed by InfoSec teams to ensure that the access granted to users for each application within an organization’s tech stack is accurate, appropriate, and aligned with security and compliance policies. Zluri’s Access Reviews module facilitates this process in a streamlined and efficient manner, providing centralized visibility into all applications that require review while offering detailed information necessary for these reviews. With Zluri, users can manage multiple app reviews efficiently, assign reviewers, and implement post-review actions. Access Review Roles and Due Dates Roles Primary Reviewer: Responsible for reviewing access certifications, verifying, and taking actions such as approving, rejecting, or modifying access. Fallback Reviewer: Assigned as the reviewer if the primary reviewer is unavailable or not correctly configured. Certification Owner: Validates access reviews, ensures completion of the review process and oversees actions taken based on reviews. Due Dates Review Start Date: The Certification can be viewed in two sections based on the Start date: Ongoing Certifications and Upcoming Certifications. Review End Date: Reviewers with pending reviews will receive alerts, along with the certification owner. Remediation End Date: The certification owner will be notified to finalize any pending remediation actions and tasks. Prerequisites Before initiating access reviews, ensure the following: Necessary roles must be set up to assign appropriate responsibilities and permissions for conducting access reviews efficiently. Deprovisioning app playbooks must be configured to automate actions for revoking or modifying access based on review outcomes. Required integrations must be connected and scoped properly to enable automated workflow actions during the access review process, ensuring seamless execution of tasks across applications. Creating a Deprovisioning Playbook Navigate to the desired application on Zluri. Navigate to Automation > Deprovisioning tab and click Add to create a new playbook. Note: Next, a pop-up window will appear, displaying all available de-provisioning actions. Add de-provisioning actions, ensuring integrations are connected. Note: If the integration is available but not connected, you can see it listed. Clicking on the integration name will redirect you to the connection screen. Once the integration is connected, you can select the instance and choose the automated action to remove or downgrade user access. You also have the option to convert the action to a manual task by clicking Convert to Manual Task if integration is not desired. Choose a template, add details, and save changes to publish the playbook. After configuring the necessary actions for access revocation or downgrade, click Publish appPlaybook to create the playbook. To view the published Deprovisioning Playbook, click View Runs or navigate to the Runs tab from the sidebar menu. Access Review Process Creating a Certification Navigate to the Access Review tab and click Create New Certification. Provide the following Certification Details and click Next. Certification Name Certification Owner Description (optional) Complete the following Set Up Certification. Click Add Application to select Applications to include, and click Next. Specify Reviewers (Primary and Fallback) and click Next. Choose Users for review using relevant filters and click Next. Select Data Columns for reviewer visibility and reference and click Next. Note: Upon clicking Save Application, you will be directed to the Set Up Certification page, where additional applications can be added. Users can modify or delete the added application by selecting the edit or delete icon. Upon adding the applications, click Next. Complete Setup for the access certification. Specify the Review Start Date and End Date. Specify the Remediation End Data and click Create Certification. Note: The automated reminders will be sent 48 hours before the due dates to the associated users. Reviewing a Certification Reviewers can access ongoing certifications and take actions on user access (approve, modify, revoke). Navigate to the Access Reviews > Ongoing tab to view the open certifications list. Find and click your certification name to open its dashboard page. Click on the application name to view review details in a sidesheet. Note: The reviewer and the certification owner can approve, remove or modify access by clicking on the actions icon for the users. Review user details and take actions (approve, remove, modify) as needed. Note: For removal or modification of access, it is neccessary to add comments for actions taken as it creates a record for audit purposes and can be referred to in the report. Reviewers can select multiple or all users and select Bulk Review Action or Delegate Review from the Bulk Edit drop-down. Reviewers cannot review their own access. Conclude Review Upon review completion, close the side sheet and click Conclude Review on the dashboard to run the actions. Note: App playbooks configured earlier will run automatically based on review actions. Complete Certification Note: A detailed PDF report is generated and sent to the certification owner. All the certifications marked as completed will be available under the Access Reviews > Completed tab. Additional Functionality Notifications: Automated notifications are sent to reviewers for pending reviews and upcoming deadlines. Cloning Campaign: Clone previous certifications to reuse configurations for similar reviews from Certification dashboard pages from Ongoing or Completed tabs. Show progress by reviewers: The certification owner can now see the progress for each reviewer assigned to an access review campaign and send reminders to specific reviewers or all reviewers who have pending reviews to complete. Employee View: Employees (app users) can view and take action on certifications assigned to them as reviewers. Updated 18 days ago"

Here's how: 📝 Sign up for a free trial Go to the Sign up page and register for a free trial using your company email. Enter your name, company name and phone number, then click Request Invite . That's it! Our representative will reach out to you as soon as possible and guide you through the process. 🏢 Add organization details After signing up, log in with your email and password, then enter organization information: 🚧 You might be asked to enter an Organization Slug in addition to your email and password. This happens if you have multiple Zluri accounts associated with the same email address. If you don't have access to this code (or wish to change it), please contact your designated Customer Success Manager. Organization name Default currency Starting month of your financial year 🖇️ Connect integrations To get the most out of Zluri, we recommend connecting as many integrations as possible. Start with these key integrations: 1. SSO (Single Sign-On) Connect your SSO provider. For most organizations this is Google Workspace , Azure AD , Okta , OneLogin , and/or JumpCloud . You can also import a custom CSV. The SSO provider will be the primary source of your organization's data. This includes departments, domains, applications the employees use, sign-in/sign-out activity, and detailed security analysis of every connected application. It is also the most important integration to discover shadow IT and optimize spendings. 2. Accounting/finance software Keep track of expenses and transactions by integrating accounting software such as Intuit Quickbooks , FreshBooks , or Brex . You can also import a custom CSV. 3. HRMS (Human Resource Management System) Connecting your HRMS will let Zluri track employee data like departments, designations, reporting managers, and joining dates. Zluri supports popular HRMS like BambooHR , Personio, and Keka . Other recommended integrations Having set the foundations, add other integrations by exploring the Integrations Catalog . See our curated list of essential integrations and staff picks for starters. 📜 Set primary sources With the key integrations in place, you might find that multiple apps might contain the same information. . For example, both Google Workspace and BambooHR might provide employees' designations and profile pictures, but you want the latter to be the source of truth for these. To remedy this, Zluri lets you choose different sources for individual fields. You can do this by setting Primary Sources Updated 19 days ago"
